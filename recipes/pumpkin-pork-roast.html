    <p>By Chef John</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I haven't posted a roasted pork tenderloin recipe for a while, but with "fancy" roasted meat season almost upon us, I thought the timing was perfect for a seasonably appropriate twist on this extremely user-friendly cut of meat. And what better way to twist something seasonally than by using the always beautiful and delicious pumpkin seeds.</p>

    <p>However, not just any old pumpkin seeds will do. We need to use the small, green, husk-less seeds, which are often sold as pepitas. I believe I heard somewhere that these are extremely good for you, and might even be considered a "super food," although I still don't fully understand what the means. (How are potato chips not a "super food"? But that's an argument for another post.) Regardless, these flavorful seeds are one of my favorite fall ingredients, and they really shine here.</p>

    <p>Besides the great taste and texture, the beautiful crust also helps keep our tenderloin nice and moist. However, it's not a magic crust, and you still have to not overcook the meat. My time rec will get you close, but please check with a thermometer. I generally shoot for 140 degrees F, to ensure a juicy slice. And if you're looking for a serving suggestion, the cayenne carrots were very nice, but no matter how you plate this, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/4 pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt </li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped pumpkin seeds </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Season pork with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in an oven-proof pan over high heat. Sear pork in the hot oil until well-browned on all sides. Turn off the heat, and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Mix mustard, maple syrup, and cumin together in a small bowl. Use a spoon to spread mustard mixture all over the surface of the pork, getting as thick a layer as possible.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pumpkin seeds on top of the mustard mixture in a thick layer, and lightly press down into the surface. Press pumpkin seeds into the sides as well.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork back into the pan and add 1/2 cup of broth.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pork to a plate and cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Place the same pan back over medium-high heat and add remaining 1/2 cup of broth, rice vinegar, and balsamic vinegar. Stir with a spoon and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook until liquid has reduced by half, about 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in butter. Taste for seasoning and serve over sliced pork.</li>
    </ol>
